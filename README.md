## Why Version Control Matters for AI Compliance in Healthcare Startups

Version control isn’t just an engineering best practice — it’s a compliance requirement.

- **Reproducibility:** Regulators and investors must be able to re-run AI results step by step.  
- **Traceability:** Every commit links data, code, and configuration to an outcome.  
- **Auditability:** Git history serves as an audit trail during HIPAA/FDA/DPDP checks.  
- **Risk Management:** Prevents “silent changes” in models that could harm patients or mislead customers.  
- **Business Trust:** Enterprise clients only adopt AI products that demonstrate audit readiness.  

This is why my AI learning repo starts with GitHub — to build investor- and regulator-ready discipline from day one. 

AI defines similarity mathematically, using vectors—numerical representations of data points (words, products, patients, etc.). These vectors live in a multi-dimensional space, and similarity is measured by how close they are to each other (using metrics like cosine similarity or Euclidean distance).
