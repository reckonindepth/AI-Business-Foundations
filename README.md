## Why Version Control Matters for AI Compliance in Healthcare Startups

Version control isn’t just an engineering best practice — it’s a compliance requirement.

- **Reproducibility:** Regulators and investors must be able to re-run AI results step by step.  
- **Traceability:** Every commit links data, code, and configuration to an outcome.  
- **Auditability:** Git history serves as an audit trail during HIPAA/FDA/DPDP checks.  
- **Risk Management:** Prevents “silent changes” in models that could harm patients or mislead customers.  
- **Business Trust:** Enterprise clients only adopt AI products that demonstrate audit readiness.  

This is why my AI learning repo starts with GitHub — to build investor- and regulator-ready discipline from day one. 

## Embeddings = profile cards; AI uses them for similarity decisions.
AI defines similarity mathematically, using vectors—numerical representations of data points (words, products, patients, etc.). These vectors live in a multi-dimensional space, and similarity is measured by how close they are to each other (using metrics like cosine similarity or Euclidean distance).

## Embeddings = profile cards.
Every patient, customer, or product gets turned into a vector (like a multi-attribute card).

## Similarity = business leverage.

- **Healthcare: AI can suggest similar patient cases → better diagnostics.

- **Retail: AI can recommend “customers like you also bought this.”

- **Language: AI connects context → GPT can answer semantically, not literally.

Leader’s takeaway: You don’t compute vectors yourself, but you must know what decisions embeddings enable (recommendations, clustering, personalization, multimodal analysis).
