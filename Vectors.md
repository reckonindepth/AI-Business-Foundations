📌 Executive Summary — 3Blue1Brown: Essence of Linear Algebra (for AI Business Leaders)
🎥 Video 1–2: Vectors & What They Mean

Visual idea: A vector is just an arrow — it has direction and magnitude.

Business translation:

Think of a patient profile (age, BMI, blood pressure) → represented as a vector.

Think of a customer purchase record (spend, frequency, recency) → also a vector.

Leader’s takeaway: Vectors = profile cards in numeric form. That’s how AI “remembers” entities.

🎥 Video 3: Linear Combinations

Visual idea: You can combine vectors (like arrows) to form new ones.

Business translation:

A customer persona can be a weighted mix of purchase behaviors.

A disease risk profile can be a mix of different patient features.

Leader’s takeaway: AI often builds new features by combining existing vectors → that’s feature engineering in action.

🎥 Video 4: Matrix Transformations

Visual idea: A matrix is like a “machine” that transforms vectors.

Stretching, rotating, or squishing the arrows in space.

Business translation:

A recommendation model applies a matrix transformation to map raw purchase data → a similarity space (e.g., “customers like you”).

In healthcare, a diagnostic AI transforms clinical features → prediction space.

Leader’s takeaway: Matrices = filters or transformations that turn raw vectors into meaningful signals.

🎯 Big Picture (Leader’s Synthesis)

Vectors = representations of entities (patients, products, words).

Combinations = new features or signals emerge by mixing attributes.

Matrices = transformations that reveal insights (patterns, clusters, predictions).

This is the mental model you need when engineers say:

“We embedded customers into a 512-dimensional vector space and ran matrix transformations.”

👉 Translate that to boardroom English:

“They represented each customer as a numerical profile, and applied transformations to find meaningful groups and predictions.”

✅ What you need (and what you don’t)

Need: Intuition → vectors are profiles; matrices are transformations.

Don’t need: Proofs, determinants, eigenvalues (skip those unless you’re curious).
